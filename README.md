This project is to teach an agent to play a level of Super Mario Bros for the NES with a reinforcement learning algorithm based on https://github.com/Sourish07/Super-Mario-Bros-RL . Using that algorithm to train the agent, The agent will be observed at different checkpoints in its learning process and will be evaluated on how effective it is.
